
Final Project - Student Performance Prediction

In this project, I analyzed student data to predict their final exam scores.
I handled missing values, transformed categorical variables, and visualized
key patterns such as the distribution of scores and the relationship between
study hours and exam results.

After splitting the dataset (80/20) and training a Linear Regression model,
the evaluation showed:
- MSE = 6.80
- RÂ² = 84.01

This means the model explains about 8401.3% of the variance in exam scores.
